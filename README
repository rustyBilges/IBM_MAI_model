This version has no functional differecne from the original version of Miguel Lurgi.

Imporvement in speed is acheived by storing Edges locally, to avoid repeated calls to networkx.

Changes due to the above are:
> In Ecosystem.py added:
 	> self.Edges = self.net.edges()
 	> self.In_degrees = self.net.in_degree()
	
	Therefore all calls to 
	> self.net.in_degree() and self.net.edges()
	replaced by:
	> self.Edges
	> self.In_degrees[]


Other differences are:
> main_cluster.py (and main_cluster_minimalist.py)  now removes links between top and bottom trophic levels in the case of networks created on the fly 
	(previously only done for networks read in from .graphml files)


> write_spatial_state() added to utilities.py 
	Spatial analysis methods are computationally expensive, this gives the option of saving spatial state if subsequent analysis is desired. Albeit snapshot of state.



> Switching off spatial analysis no longer causes crash. This was a big problem since thiese analyses method were so slow (could probably be optimised?). However setting the flag SPATIAL_VARIATION = False caused the program to crash in calls to  get_out_row() because certain variables were instantiated in conditonal clauses that did not execute when spatial analysis was switched off. This has been fixed in the function  get_out_row().

> Network creator allowed for links between trophic levels 1 and 4. We now protoype a method for replace these links...


Other potential changes are:

> _update_realised_network() is still called on every move() and eat() event.
	Removing these calls gives further speed up (fewer networkx calls), but does not allow us ot work with the realised network.

> The method for network creation does not work above ~70species. That is the niche model cannot produce a network that meets the default trophic constraints within a sensible time.
	In the case of large networks, it is required to either relax these constraints, or to follow another network generation algorithm (see thesis chapter on stabiltiy of networks)

> The method find_trophic_positions() in web.py is not compatible with large networks (anyhting above about 80sp), causing the program to crash.
	This method can be commented out and all return values set to zero, however this breaks the calculation of network stats.

> A version coflict of networkx has been fixed by adding:
        if nx.__version__=='1.7': 
            cycles = nx.algorithms.cycles.simple_cycles(self)
        else:
            cycles = list(nx.algorithms.cycles.simple_cycles(self))

> Many commented lines were removed from main_cluster.py  (see main_cluster_old.py for original stuff that may have been lost)
